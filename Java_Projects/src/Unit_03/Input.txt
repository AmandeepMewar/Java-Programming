I spend a lot of nights thinking
I might go to sleep and never wake up
I spend a lot of money on these therapy sessions
Even though I'm not showing up
I spend a lot of time healing my mind and my heart
But I still put these drugs in my gut
Me and my girl were just screaming at each other
Right before we both got out of the truck
I got some demons inside
I'm tryna free them inside
I'm from the Cleveland East Side
Where the boy who was just starving with you
Now might try to eat you alive, damn
Y'all said that switched genres
I saw the limit and took it farther
I'm a genius, could've made Donda
But this song is for my dead father, uh
