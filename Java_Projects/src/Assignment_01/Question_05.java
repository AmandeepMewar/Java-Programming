/*
5Q. WAP in Java which would contain 8 objects of a Class Employee.
Employee contains name, age, department, salary. Your program would
be able to calculate the total salary to be paid in each department. Use
constructors to create these 8 objects and Scanner to take inputs.
Restrictions:
1- Minimum 8 objects [can be created manually with parameterized
constructors with Scanner input]
2- Departments are, A, B, C, D: minimum 4 departments [String Type]
3- If the Salary exceeds more than 30,000, then the default salary
would be 25000 of any of the employee
4- Use array of objects, instead of using multiple 8 objects separately
Use:
Employee arr[] = new Employee[8];
And
arr[i].department.equals("A");
