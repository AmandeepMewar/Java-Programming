Q3- Given an interface in1 which includes a method display which takes
an integer as input .
interface In1
{
void display(int p);
}
Task is to write a class testClass which implements interface In1 and has
a method named display which takes an integer as an input p and the
display method should be able to tell if the number is prime or not?
- The main method should not be in testClass, create a separate class for
that.
